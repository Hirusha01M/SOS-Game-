# SOS-Game-
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic SOS game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing either "S" or "O" in an attempt to form the sequence "SOS" either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game announces a winner when a player successfully forms "SOS", and a draw if the grid is filled without any winning sequence. The game also includes a restart button to reset the grid and start a new game.
